# Nibble
## What is a Nibble?
Nibble is a multi-purpose, modular Discord bot written by @keli5_letters. It's also a nibble.
## How do I use it?
There are two ways to use it:
### Host your own!
1. Clone the bot: `git clone https://github.com/keli5/nibble.git`, then `cd nibble`
2. Fill out the config:
	1. `cp config.example.json config.json`
	2. Edit config.json in your text editor of choice. Fields should be self-explanatory.
3. Install dependencies: `npm i`
4. (if required) You may have to configure Postgres and/or Prisma. This is kind of up to you; I really have no set method for getting this working.
5. Run the bot: `node .`

Or, if that's not really your thing:

## How do I make it better?
Issues and pull requests are always welcome. Just don't fuck it all up, preferably.
